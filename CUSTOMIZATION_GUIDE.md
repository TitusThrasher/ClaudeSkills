## Welcome!

This template helps you create a Claude skill for monitoring and documenting ICE and CBP enforcement activity in **your** city, town, or state. This guide walks you through adapting the template files to match your local context.

---

## Overview: What You're Creating

This skill will give Claude the ability to:
1. **Search** local and national sources for ICE/CBP enforcement incidents in your area
2. **Extract** structured data from various source types (news, social media, legal docs)
3. **Document** incidents in a standardized 11-field database format
4. **Verify** information across multiple sources
5. **Track** patterns and trends over time

---

## Quick Start: 5-Step Process

### Step 2: Customize the Core Files
‚è±Ô∏è **20 minutes** | üìä **Progress: 25% ‚Üí 70%**

#### File: `SKILL.md` (Main instructions for Claude)

**Find and replace these placeholders:**

| Placeholder | Replace With | Example |
|-------------|--------------|---------|
| `[CITY_NAME]` | Your city name | "Portland" |
| `[STATE_NAME]` | Your state name | "Oregon" |
| `[METRO_AREA]` | Metropolitan area name | "Portland Metropolitan Area" |
| `[OPERATION_NAME]` | Named operation (if any) | "Operation Jumping Frogs" |
| `[START_DATE]` | When monitoring began | "October 2025" |

**Update these sections:**

1. **Purpose section** (lines 8-11):
   - Change location references
   - Update operation name if applicable
   - Adjust time frame

2. **Key Sources to Monitor** (lines 99-122):
   - Replace with your local news outlets
   - Update community organization names and websites
   - Add your local rapid response networks
   - Include your federal court info

3. **Neighborhood Examples** (throughout):
   - Replace Chicago neighborhood names with your neighborhoods
   - Update ZIP codes to match your area
   - Adjust geographic references

4. **Contact Resources** (lines 305-313):
   - Update hotline numbers for your state/region
   - Replace organization names with your local groups
   - Update websites and contact information

**Example Search/Replace:**
```
Find: "Chicago"
Replace: "Portland"

Find: "Illinois"
Replace: "Oregon"

Find: "Operation Midway Blitz"
Replace: "Jumping Frogs"

Find: "Back of the Yards"
Replace: "Bridgeton"
```

#### File: `README.md` (User-facing documentation)

**Update these sections:**

1. **Overview** (top):
   - Change "Chicago" to your city
   - Update operation name
   - Adjust dates

2. **Data Structure Table** (lines 66-81):
   - Change example addresses to local ones
   - Update neighborhoods to your neighborhoods
   - Use your local ZIP codes

3. **Source Coverage** (lines 99-105):
   - List YOUR local news outlets
   - Name YOUR rapid response networks
   - Include YOUR community organizations

4. **Customization Section** (lines 182-202):
   - Update "Currently optimized for" with your geography
   - Adjust primary/secondary/context areas

5. **Contact Section** (bottom):
   - Update creator name (or remove if making public)
   - Update organization name
   - Adjust license/usage notes as appropriate

#### File: `reference/examples.md`

You have two options:

**Option A: Keep Generic (Easier)**
- Leave the Chicago examples as-is
- Add a note at the top: "These examples use Chicago data. Apply the same methodology to your local sources."

**Option B: Create Local Examples (More Work)**
- Replace each example with incidents from your area
- Use your local street names, neighborhoods, ZIP codes
- Include bilingual content if relevant to your community

**Recommendation:** Start with Option A, update later with real examples as you document incidents.

#### File: `reference/search-strategies.md`

**Update search queries to include:**
- Your city name: `"ICE [YOUR_CITY] arrest today"`
- Your neighborhoods: `"ICE activity [YOUR_NEIGHBORHOOD]"`
- Your local news sites: `site:[yourlocalnews.com] ICE`

**Example transformations:**
```
Before: "ICE Chicago arrest today"
After: "ICE Miami arrest today"

Before: "site:blockclubchicago.org ICE"
After: "site:miamiherald.com ICE"

Before: "Pilsen immigration raid"
After: "Little Havana immigration raid"
```

#### File: `reference/integration-guide.md`

**Minimal changes needed:**
- Update workflow examples to use your city name
- Change neighborhood references to your areas
- Otherwise, the workflows are largely geography-agnostic

## Advanced Customization

### Adjusting Data Fields

The default schema has 11 fields. You may want to:

**Add fields:**
- "Immigration Court Location" for your district
- "State/Local Law Enforcement Involvement" 
- "Language Services Provided"
- "Legal Status of Detention" (warrant vs. administrative)

**To add a field:**
1. Add to "Data Schema" section in SKILL.md
2. Update output format template
3. Add to quality checklist
4. Update example extractions

**Remove fields:**
If certain fields don't apply to your context, mark as "Optional" and add usage notes.

### Adjusting Search Frequency

Default recommendations:
- Daily: Morning + evening (15 minutes each)
- Weekly: 60-minute deep dive

Adjust based on:
- **High activity area:** Increase to 3x daily
- **Low activity area:** Reduce to 2-3x weekly
- **Historical documentation:** Weekly is sufficient

### Language Considerations

**If your community is primarily English:**
- Remove Spanish-language notes from extraction guidelines
- Simplify bilingual processing sections

**If your community uses other languages:**
- Add common terms in those languages (see SKILL.md lines 162-167 for Spanish example)
- Note which sources publish in which languages
- Add translation considerations to quality guidelines

**If your community is multilingual:**
- Expand language support sections
- Document which rapid response networks use which languages
- Consider multiple language versions of rapid response guidelines

### Special Operational Contexts

**Sanctuary City:**
- Track exceptions to sanctuary policies
- Document state/federal conflicts
- Monitor court challenges
- Focus on ICE workarounds

**287(g) Jurisdiction:**
- Track local law enforcement involvement
- Document jail cooperation
- Monitor booking procedures
- Track detainer issuance

**High-Profile Operation:**
- Increase search frequency
- Add operation-specific terminology
- Track official announcements
- Monitor political statements

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Claude keeps using Chicago instead of my city"

**Solution:** You missed some replacements. Do a full-text search:
```bash
grep -r "Chicago" ice-cbp-monitoring/
```
Replace remaining instances.

### "Claude suggests news sources I didn't configure"

**Solution:** Claude may be using general knowledge. Be more explicit in prompts:
```
"Use ONLY the local sources configured in this skill"
```

### "My rapid response networks don't use Instagram"

**Solution:** Update the Instagram-specific sections:
1. Change "Instagram alerts" to your platforms (Facebook, Telegram, etc.)
2. Update image extraction guidelines to match your platform's format
3. Adjust URL format examples

### "We don't have named neighborhoods, just ZIP codes"

**Solution:** 
1. Replace neighborhood fields with ZIP-focused location tracking
2. Update examples to use ZIP+street address
3. Simplify location extraction rules

### "The data schema doesn't match our needs"

**Solution:** See "Adjusting Data Fields" above. Common changes:
- Combine "Agencies Involved" with "Description"
- Split "Use of Force" into severity levels
- Add "Source Credibility Rating"
